# React Native Network Request Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving network requests: improper error handling.  The initial code lacks robust error handling, potentially resulting in unexpected UI behavior (such as a persistent loading state or the display of stale data). The solution demonstrates how to correctly implement error handling to make the application more resilient and user-friendly. 

## Problem

The provided React Native component fetches data from an API. However, it lacks comprehensive error handling.  If the network request fails, the application might freeze in a loading state or display outdated information.

## Solution

The solution enhances error handling by:

1.  Including a `catch` block to handle potential errors during the fetch operation.
2.  Updating the UI to reflect an error state if the request fails.
3.  Using `finally` to ensure that the loading indicator is always turned off, regardless of the request's success or failure.

This improved approach results in a more robust and user-friendly experience.
